# Salt Bae: the Game
A phaser 3 based gyruss clone web game. 

The shift, space, and cursor keys are the default control keys; these can be changed in opening screen's "options" submenu, however.

This version is for desktop only at the moment, keyboard controls are configured but no mobile controls are coded yet.
